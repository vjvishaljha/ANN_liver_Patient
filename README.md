# ANN_liver_Patient
Classification Model 

This data set contains 416 liver patient records and 167 non liver patient records.The data set was collected from north east of Andhra Pradesh, India. Selector is a class label used to divide into groups(liver patient or not). This data set contains 441 male patient records and 142 female patient records.

Any patient whose age exceeded 89 is listed as being of age "90".

## Attribute Information:
1. Age - Age of the patient
2. Gender- Gender of the patient
3. TB Total Bilirubin
4. DB Direct Bilirubin
5. Alkphos Alkaline Phosphotase
6. Sgpt Alamine Aminotransferase
7. Sgot Aspartate Aminotransferase
8. TP Total Protiens
9. ALB Albumin
10. A/G Ratio Albumin and Globulin Ratio
11. Selector field used to split the data into two sets (labeled by the experts)

# Clasification
It separates observations into groups based on their characteristics. For instance, students applying to medical schools could be separated into likely accepted, maybe accepted, and unlikely expected based on grades, MCAT scores, medical experience, and outstanding activities.

We have used the ANN(Artifical Neural Network) Model for solving this classfication problem.
ANN Classification is an example of Supervised Learning. Known class labels help indicate whether the system is performing correctly or not. This information can be used to indicate a desired response, validate the accuracy of the system, or be used to help the system learn to behave correctly. The known class labels can be thought of as supervising the learning process; the term is not meant to imply that you have some sort of interventionist role.

Our Goal is to predict whether a person is a liver patient on the basis of the symptoms given.
